# CodeJam Project 2023

THEME: SECRET CODES

Objective: Hide some parts of an image from anyone who opens it without a proper key.

Premises:
 - It will use regular images in standard format files.
 - The encrypted files can be opened in a standard image reader, but the hidden parts will not be shown
 - We will have an app to encode/decode an image.
 - We will have to share a key or password for someone to see the hidden images with our app.

Questions to define the scope for the project:
 1. What kind of images are we going to work with?
 2. How are we going to hide the image part?
 3. What is the target audience?
 4. How secure should our application be?
